# data/

Files in this folder contain high-level, easy-to-digest data for three primary security metrics: MTD, MTA, and MTR.

This is the data you get upon clicking the "Download" buttons within the web app. It only contains summary statistics for these security metrics. If you would like to look through the full, raw data pulled from your API, check out the csvs in logs/.
